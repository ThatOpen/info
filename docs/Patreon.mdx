## Where does my money go?

💛 We manage all money through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ifcjs). That means that anyone can see who has put how much money into the project.

💵 Every time we want to use that money we will have to upload an invoice that will be published on the same page. That way, **the money is as open as the code**.
