🤷‍♀️️
We all want the same thing: to create our own BIM applications and do business. However, if we all develop applications from scratch, **we will never be able to compete with the industry giants**.

🤝
So we want to propose you to **join forces**.

<Sponsoring/>

## How does it work?

👩‍💻
It's easy: anyone can use IFC.js commercially without any limitations. However, each BIM application is different, and it is likely that as you build your application, **you will create new cool BIM functionalities**.

🔥
Of course, you could implement those features in your closed source application... or you could **implement them directly in IFC.js**.

### But wait, why on earth would I do that!?

💪💪💪
It is pointless to compete with each other for the scraps of the big BIM software companies. However, **if we join forces, we can make this a fair fight**.

🤖
Also, by doing so you would become a **code sponsor**. This grants you the following advantages:

<IfcCard icon="🏆" title="Your needs go FIRST">
    We will implement everything you need from the library very quickly. Your needs will have top priority over the rest.
</IfcCard>

<IfcCard icon="🥇" title="Decision-making power">
    Do you think the library should go in a particular direction? You can decide! You will have a say in the direction of the project.
</IfcCard>

<IfcCard icon="🚀" title="Early access to new functionalities">
    You will be able to access new project functionalities before anyone else; a competitive advantage in your BIM app.
</IfcCard>

<IfcCard icon="👥" title="Access to exclusive chat for maintainers">
    You will have a direct line to us and you will be able to see how the project is cooked behind closed doors.
</IfcCard>

### What does it cost me?

👌
**Absolutely nothing**, not even time. Simply put, instead of reserving all of your BIM code for yourself, you can leave some of it open in IFC.js.

<IfcAlert>
    It's simply a question of which repository you save your code to.
</IfcAlert>

### Are there really any companies participating?

💼
Yes, and **some of them are worth millions**. If the programme is good enough for them, maybe it's good enough for your company.

💰💰💰
These companies are creating their own BIM software from scratch, tailor-made and **without paying anything at all**.

### Do you seriously think you can compete with the big BIM software companies?

🌈
In 2020 nobody thought you could create BIM applications in 50 lines of code; now, thanks to IFC.js, it's trivial. In one year, 3 people from different countries and companies have achieved that in our spare time.

🤝
Can you imagine how much we could achieve **with your contribution?**

<IfcCard>
    The thought that we cannot compete with them is a thought that only benefits them. Are we going to admit that we have already lost before we try?
</IfcCard>

### But I know nothing about the project!

👩‍🏫
Don't worry: if you want to participate, we will give **top priority to your onboarding** so that you can start using the library right away and help us with whatever you want.

### Do I have to share all my code?

🔑
No! **You can share only those parts that you want** and that can be interesting for the whole community. There is no minimum size to be a sponsor, so don't worry.

### What if I am an educational institution?

👩‍🏫
Great! If you decide to include IFC.js in your teaching programme, you can also be a sponsor. Contact us, and we will be at your disposal to train you, solve your and your students' doubts and help them to enter the world of Open BIM.
