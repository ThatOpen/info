## Why aren't these courses free?

IFC.js is (and always will be) free for everyone. However, in order to keep growing the project, we need funds to organize events, pay project expenses, reward the active community and much more. These courses are a way to get those funds.

The money from the courses is reinvested entirely in the project. You can see how we manage the funds in a totally transparent way at [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ifcjs).

Would you like us to spend this money somewhere else? You can join the project as [sponsor](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Contribute) or [patreon](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Contribute) and have a say in where we spend these funds.

## How much do they cost?

### For non-patreons

Each course costs **$100** for non-patreons. But that money doesn't go to us, it goes to the project. Therefore, to purchase a course you just need to make a donation of $100 in open collective and send us the voucher and the course (or courses) you want to get access to.

### For patreons

Patreons can purchase courses at a great discount based on their patreon membership. Each uninterrupted month's stay in the patreon discounts all the courses by $15, up to a maximum of $25.

In other words, a community member who commits to stay in the patreon for 6 months can purchase **any course for $25**.

In addition, they will have **exclusive content** to which general users do not have access and the power to decide on the subject matter of the next courses.

Of course, patreons also have [all other advantages included in the patreon tier](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Patreon).

### For corporate patreons

Corporate patreons have **free** access to all courses for up to 20 employees, as well as live webinars from the creators of the library to their development teams, prime support and all other benefits granted by the [corporate patreon](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Patreon).

### Adaptative discount

We are aware that the world is diverse and not all countries have the same purchasing power. However, we do not want to leave out people in countries with more economic difficulties. If the average salary in your country is less than $1000, you can apply the **adaptative discount**.

This discount gives access to the courses for a price equal to the proportional difference between the average salary in your country and $1000. For example, if the average salary is $800, you get a 20% discount. If the average salary is $400, the discount would be 60%.

## How do I enroll?

🚧 The courses are not ready yet! We are working really hard to make them happen as soon as possible. In the meantime, you can become a patreon and get a great discount when they get out (as described above). We estimate that they will be released in March.

👌 Once they are released, make a donation to our [open-collective account](https://opencollective.com/ifcjs) and we will give you access to everything.
