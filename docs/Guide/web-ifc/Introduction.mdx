## Full IFC control at native speed

🌎
It is often thought that web applications are not as powerful as desktop applications. Relatively recently, however, [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) appeared on the scene.

<IfcAlert>WebAssembly is a technology that allows the use of languages like C++ to create web applications.</IfcAlert>

🔥🔥🔥
This means we can have the best of both worlds: the **flexibility** of a web application and the **full performance** of a machine. And this is what web-ifc is all about. You can install it with `npm i web-ifc` or `yarn add web-ifc` and it has the following features:

<IfcCard>
  ⚡ It is as <b>fast</b> as native applications thanks to its parsing core, written from scratch in C++.
</IfcCard>

<IfcCard>
  🚀 It can be run directly on the <b>client</b> or as a <b>backend service</b>. Bring BIM to all parts of your system!
</IfcCard>

<IfcCard>
  📚 It can read <b>100% of the IFC data, including IFC types</b>. This allows data to be easily extracted, structured, traversed and entered into databases.
</IfcCard>

<IfcCard>
  🌈 It can <b>edit data and write entire IFCs from scratch</b>. Create apps that communicate with the large software vendors.
</IfcCard>

In the following points, the API and its functionalities will be shown step by step. However, there are a <b>some issues</b> that are important to be clear about before using `web-ifc`.

### But wait, I don't know C++!

👌
Don't worry! Although the parser is written in C++, it is compiled in a file called `web-ifc.wasm` that **browsers understand automatically**. Just include this file in your application and you will have access to the full API with native speed with **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**. How cool is that?

### What is the .wasm file for?

🧠
The web-ifc.wasm file contains the IFC **parsing core**. It is pre-compiled and **hyper-efficient**; unlike JavaScript, which has to be compiled line by line, this file can be sent directly to the CPU and executed without prior interpretation.

📦
You can find this file in the `node-modules/web-ifc/web-ifc.wasm` folder. You will need to serve this file with your application (if frontend) or have it on your server (if backend).

<IfcAlert>Beware: when you update the web-ifc version in your application, you will also have to update (copy) the corresponding version of web-ifc.wasm .</IfcAlert>

### When should I use web-ifc?

🦅
`Web-ifc` is the **lightest** and **most flexible** module of IFC.js. However, this flexibility also means that you have to know what you are doing, and therefore know the internals of the IFC schema relatively well.

☝
Moreover, web-ifc **does not implement a 3d viewer**. This is an advantage, because it means that you can get IFC geometry without relying on a particular 3d renderer in a more agile way.

<IfcCard>
  If you want to see 3d geometry easily, you will either have to implement it yourself, or use <b>web-ifc-three</b> or <b>web-ifc-viewer</b>.
