## Understanding IFC.js

  🐟🐠🐡
IFC.js is not just a library: it is an ecosystem of libraries and projects that make creating BIM tools trivial. There are two reasons for this modularity:

- To be able to use in our applications only what we need.
- To make the library more maintainable.

It is important to understand which pieces make it up in order to know what to use in each case. IFC.js is essentially composed of 3 layers, each with a unique responsibility.
